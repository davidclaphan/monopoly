# monopoly-python
Portfolio project for CS162

This program is a simplified version of Monopoly, the Portfolio Project for CS162 - Introduction to Computer Science II at Oregon State University. Instead of the classic properties you would find in Monopoly, the properties in this program are all based on locations or landmarks in Chicago, IL.
